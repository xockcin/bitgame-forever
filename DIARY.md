This is my newest and, hopefully, last attempt to implement my dream portfolio project - hence the name.

This time I will use TypeScript from the beginning. I will also use Jest and pursue a TDD strategy.

I only get to work on this thing for an hour or so at a time, so I need to be able to hit the ground running every day. That means breaking it down into minimal unit operations that I can write, test and be done with.

The game plan is to build a demo edition with no backend. You will start from the beginning every time. Eventually I will build a backend so that people can have their own accounts, sign in, keep their progress, etc., but that's a long ways off.
